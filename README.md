# Bayesian modelling
NBA shooting efficiency using R
This is a course final project of Bayesian Modeling from University of Illinois. This course explores practical methods and models for
Bayesian data analysis. The major topics include Bayesian fundamentals, hierachical models computation and evaluation.

Who has the highest shooting percentage among the top NBA point guards. Is it related to the professional of years of experience? In this
project, a heirarchical model including a logistic regression and binomial is used to assess the probability of shooting. Each player is 
treated as individual group by introducing a random effect called player effect.
